## üóÉÔ∏è Task Organization & GTD Method

Implement advanced task organization inspired by the GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology. This would help users manage their tasks more efficiently and reduce stress by clarifying priorities and next steps.

### GTD-Inspired Lists

- **Inbox:** A default list for quick capture of any new task or idea. Users can later process and move these tasks to the appropriate list.
- **Today:** Tasks that are scheduled or prioritized for completion today. This view helps users focus on immediate priorities.
- **Next Actions:** The next physical actions required to move projects forward. This list is for actionable, concrete steps.
- **Someday/Maybe:** A place to store ideas, dreams, or tasks that users might want to tackle in the future but are not ready to commit to yet.
- **Waiting For:** Tasks that are delegated or dependent on someone else. This helps users track follow-ups and avoid bottlenecks.

### Possible Features

- Allow users to move tasks between lists with drag-and-drop or quick actions.
- Filter and view tasks by list, context, or due date.
- Visual indicators for overdue, scheduled, or delegated tasks.
- Weekly review mode to help users reflect and reorganize their lists.
- Option to archive completed or obsolete tasks for future reference.

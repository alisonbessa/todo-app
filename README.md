# Todo App

A modern, minimal, and beautiful Todo List application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS. This project demonstrates best practices in component-driven development, state management, and UI/UX design. Perfect for learning, inspiration, or as a foundation for your own productivity tools.

## 🧩 Component-Driven Architecture

- **Reusable Components:** All UI elements (buttons, inputs, badges, cards) are built as isolated, reusable components.
- **Core Components:** Task management logic is encapsulated in core components for clarity and maintainability.
- **Custom Hooks:** State and logic (like task CRUD and persistence) are abstracted into custom hooks for reusability.
- **Type Safety:** All data models and props are strictly typed with TypeScript.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install # or npm install or yarn
   ```
3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
4. **Open in your browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## 📦 Build for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` folder.

## 📝 Technical Details

- **Task Model:**
  ```ts
  export interface Task {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    concluded?: boolean;
    state?: TaskState;
  }
  ```
- **Persistence:** All tasks are stored in `localStorage` under the key `tasks`.
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS utility classes are used throughout for rapid, consistent styling.
- **SVG Icons:** Imported as React components for flexibility and performance.
- **Linting:** ESLint with recommended and type-aware rules ensures code quality.
